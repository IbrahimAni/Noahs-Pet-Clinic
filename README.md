# Noahs-Pet-Clinic

Noah’s Pet Clinic (NPC), a veterinary office in rural Manchester, is a specialised dog clinic but also has other types of pets. The clinic has mainly two types of workers: vet doctors
and vet nurses. The managing director at PNC is looking to upgrade their paper-based appointment and registration system which is not very accessible or efficient. Currently,
pet owners will call NPC reception to make appointments for their pets. The owners can either call up and make an appointment for a routine check-up or if their pet is unwell. The
receptionist will answer these calls and make a note of appointments within the NPC appointment diary (see Figure 1). Appointment cancellations can also be made by phone.
However, on the day cancellations come with a £5 cancellation fee that the owner must pay on their next visit. Both doctors and nurses find it difficult to constantly find and access this diary in order to
search for appointment details. On some occasions the diary has been misplaced by a doctor/nurse. Hence, doctors and nurses need a better system where they can all retrieve
both pet and appointment details. There is usually a Pet registration form for the Owner to fill in.
